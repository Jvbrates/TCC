# TCC

This course conclusion work was developed in the 3rd year of high school of the computer technician integrated to the high school of IFFar.

When I developed it, I didn't intend to make this repository public, I just used it as a backup. This justifies the lack of responsibility in the elaboration in the comments of the commits.

Full documentation including methodology, functional requirements, database diagram and site images can be found here [TCC Documentation](https://github.com/Jvbrates/TCC/blob/main/Documenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20TCC.docx.pdf)
